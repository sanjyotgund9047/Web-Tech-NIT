CSS Introduction:
  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading refers to the styles that are applied to elements in a web page.CSS is used to style/design the layout or appearance of web pages.
 
  CSS can be used in HTML in three ways
     i. Inline Styling
     ii. internal Styling
     iii. External Styling

i. inline styling: It is used to apply styles to a specific element using 'style' as atrribute.
   <element style="property:value;.....">content</element>

ii. internal Styling: It is used to appy styles to a specific element or multiple elements using selectors and style as an 'element'
    <style>
        selector
        {
          property:value;....
        }
    </style>

    inline> internal

 iii. Exteral Styling: it is used to apply styles to single/multiple elements in a separate file with .css extension and attach it to the HTML using 'link' tag
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />

CSS styles of internal and External can override each other based on which comes last

!important is the highest preference for properties
h1{
    color: red !important;
}
!important > inline >internal/external

Basic selectors: 
    To apply styles to multiple elements, we need to select the elements. For that, we use selectors. Most common selectors are:

    i. Tag name selector: it is used to select all elements of specific tag name.
         tagname{
            properties:values;
         }
    
    ii. class Name:  'class' is an attribute to elements which is used to select multiple elements. one element may contain multiple class names and multiple elements may contain the same class name
      .className{
        properties:value;
      }

    iii. id: id is used to identify an element uniquely. No two elements have same id and No element will contain more than one id
    #idName{
        properties:values;
    }

id>class>tagname
   
    iv. universal selector: if you want apply styles to all elements in a webpage, you can universal selector (*)

    *{
        text-align:center;
    }
