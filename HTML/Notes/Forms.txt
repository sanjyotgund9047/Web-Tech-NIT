HTML Forms : Forms are used to collect the data from web pages.
  Eg: login, signup, forgot password, survey , feedback, profile, email newsletter, contact, appointment, checkout, complaint
  Every form is between 'form' element.form element contains inputs and buttons to submit or reset the forms.
  forms collect the data and send to the server via javascript.

  Inputs can be entered using 'input' tag. input tag is a self closing tag. Every input will have attributes like

   type --- it defines the type of input it will hold
   placeholder -- A dummy text to hold the place, to make users understand what to type
   id -- A name to idetify only that element uniquely.

 Instead of placeholders, we can also use 'labels' using 'label' tag. A label tag contains attribute 'for' which will contain target elements 'id'

 'form' elements also have attributes such as 
    action -- file/page to submit the data
    method -- to represent the way to send the data . it is of two types
    get and post.
    get will send the data and include the data in URL
    post will send the data but does not include in URL.

  To send the data, every input should contain attribute 'name' to represent the name we use to send the data
