Javascript :  Javascript is a client side Programming Language which is used build interactive websites using HTML and CSS. Javascript controls the behaviour of web pages and provides functionality to the web pages

    Javascript was created in 1995(dec 4) by Breden Eich while working at Netscape. Initially it is named as Mocha later changed as LiveScript. To use the popularity of Java, Livescript renamed as Javascript

Javascript runs in the Browsers because Every Browser contains an Engine to run Javascript called JS Engine. The popular JS Engines are v8(chrome),spiderMonkey(mozilla),chakra(edge). It can also run without Browsers, on server called node JS.

Javascript is a high level, dynamic Programming Language that makes website alive. 
Think building a website is like building a house
  HTML --- the walls, windows, doors (structure) -- what we see
  CSS  --- painting, decorations,style      -- how it looks
  JS   --- electricity, water, switches     -- how it works

How to Include JS in HTML ?
we can include JS in HTML in two ways . They are:
   i. Internal Javascript
   ii. External Javascript

i. Internal Javascript : we can include Javascript using 'script' as a element
     eg : 
         <script>
            here you can write javascript

         </script>

ii. External Javascript : we can include External Javascript file(.js file) to HTML using script tag with src 'attribute'
     eg: <script src="filepath" ></script>

In Javascript , there are two types of comments
   a. single line, starts with '//'
   b. multi line , starts with '/*' and ends with '*/'
comments are used for user readability purpose

variables in Javascript: In Javascript , we can declare a varible using keywords such as 'var' ,'let' and 'const'. variables / literals are used to store the values
  Difference between var, let and const
  var                         let                                const
 'var' variables can be     let and const variables 
  redeclared                cannot be reclared
  eg: var a=10;
  var a=20;
 
  'var' variables can be    'let' variables can also be      'const' varibles cannot be
  changed                   changed                           changed
  eg: var a=10;             eg:let a=10;
  a=20;                       a=20

  var variables are       let and const are block scoped variables
  function scoped

To accept input , we use one method called prompt. but prompt accepts only strings.
let a = +prompt("enter a value")
