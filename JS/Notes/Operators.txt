Operators: Operators are used to perform operation.There are different types of Operators such as
        1.Arithmetic Operators: (+,-,*,/(direct division),%(remainder),**(power))
        
        2.relational Operators: These operators are used for comparision 
        (>, <, >=, <=, ==)

        == -- it will compares only values not datatypes
        
        === -- it will compares values and datatypes

        != -- returns negation of ==
        
        !== -- returns negation of ===

        3.Logical Operators: These operators are used for combining statements logically 
            i.Logical AND (&&) : it will return true only both are the true
            ii.Logical OR (||) : It will return true any one are the true
            iii.Logical NOT (!) : It will be true when actual statement will false
            
        4. Increment and Decrement Operators : These are unary operator which is used to incremant(Increase the value by  1)
           and Decrement (Decrease the value by 1)
           Pre-Increment : It first updates the value and return it
           Post-Increment :It is used to returns the value and upadate it

           let a = 10;
           let x = ++a + a++;
            cansole.log(x);

        5.Ternary Operators  Or Conditional Operators: It is the shorthand operator used to check the Condition true or false and 
        make a decision based on that values
        let a =10;
        let c = (a>b)? 20 :30;

        let num =+ prompt("Enter a value");
        let result =(num%2==0)?"Even":"Odd"
        console.log(`${result}`)

        6.nullish coalescing operaor : it will cjeck two values and return first value if is not 
        undefined or null, else if returns second values
        let a = 10;
        let b = 20;
        let c = a ?? b;
