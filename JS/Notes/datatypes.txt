DataTypes in Javascript:
  Javascript is a dynamic programming language. it means in Javascript, there is no fixed datatype to a variable. The datatype of a variable is decided by value it is holding.

  There are two categories of datatypes:
     i. primitive data DataTypes
     ii. non primitive datatypes

    i. primitive datatypes : These datatypes holds the value and compares only value. These datatypes are immutable.
      There are 5 basic primitive DataTypes such as
      number, string, boolean, undefined , null

    ii. non primitive DataTypes : these datatypes holds the value and compares the address/reference . These datatypes are mutable
        The basic non primitive datatypes are 
        functions, arrays, objects

can we change one datatype to another datatype?
  yes, The process of changing one datatype to another datatype is called typecasting. There are two types of typecasting
  i. implicit typecasting
  ii. explicit typecasting

i. implicit typecasting : it is the default or automatic conversion of datatypes based on operation
  eg:  10 + "5"  ===> "10"+"5" ===> "105",
    5 * '4' ===> 5*4 ==>20
  

ii. explicit typecasting : it is the forced way of converting one datatype to another
  eg :   5 + +'4' ===> 5 + 4 ==>9
         5 + Number('4') ==> 5+4==>9

number : Any numerical value is a number
  Every number can have some default methods such as toString, toPrecision etc..,
  numbers also have math methods such as sqrt, cbrt, pow, ceil, floor etc..,
