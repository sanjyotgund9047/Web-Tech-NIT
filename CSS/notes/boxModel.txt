Box Model:  Browsers treat Every element as a Box. A Box contains
   i. border
   ii. border-radius
   iii. padding
   iv. margin

i. border : border is the surrounding line for an element
          border: size shape color;
   we can even assign border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom

ii. border-radius : it is the corner radius surround the border corners.
         border-radius:size;
         50% of border-radius make actual circle for square shape 
         we can also assign each corner radius separately

iii. padding: it is the space between border and actual content of element(inside the element)
         padding:size;
    we can also assign padding as padding-left,padding-right,padding-top,padding-bottom
    Normally, padding makes each box increase its height or width because by default all are content boxes.so we need to use
    box-sizing:border-box;

iv. margin : it is the space outside the border . used for gap between the elements
     margin:size;
    we can also assign margin as margin-left,margin-right,margin-top,margin-bottom
